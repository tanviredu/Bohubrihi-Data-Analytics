DATABASE NORMALIZATION:
	NORMALIZATION IS A TECHNIQUE TO MINIMISE DATA REDUNDENCY
	WHAT IS REDUNDENCY:
		REPITATION OF SIMILLER DATA IN MULTIPLE PLACE

		IF IT HAPENS:

		1) INSERTION  ANOMALY
		2) UPDATE     ANOMALY
		3) DELETION   ANOMALY
		4) UNNECESSARY SPACE COMSUMPTION

IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROLEM WE USE 3 NORMAL FORM

REDUDANT TABLE:

STUDENT_ID		NAME		SUBJECT		HOD		PHONE
1 				ANDALIB		MATH        MR.X    123
2               NABILA 		MATH        MR.X    123
3               SAKIB		BUSINESS	MS.Y    233
4				RAHMAN		BUSINESS	MS.Y    233

TO MAKE IT LESS REDUNDANT WE CAN BREAK THE TABLE



STUDENT TABLE:

STUDENT_ID		NAME		SUBJECT		
1 				ANDALIB		MATH        
2               NABILA 		MATH        
3               SAKIB		BUSINESS	
4				RAHMAN		BUSINESS	


SUBJECT TABLE:

SUBJECT		HOD		PHONE
MATH        MR.X    123
MATH        MR.X    123
BUSINESS	MS.Y    233
BUSINESS	MS.Y    233


NOW IF WE WANT TO UPDATE OR DELETE ANY TEACHER WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT SACRIFICING OUT STUDENT INFORMATION.








FIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF):
	1) EACH CELLS SHPULD HOLD A SINGLE VALUE.
	   YOU CAN T ADD THE DATA WITH A COMMA LIKE
	   THIS

	  STUDENT_ID NAME		SUBJECT
	  1 		 TANVIR		SQL,PYTHON
	  2          ORNOB   	JAVA,PYTHON
	  3          SAKIB   	JS

YOU CANT DO THAT, SINGLE VALUE WILL BE ADDED NOT MULTIPEL VALUE

	AFTER APPLYING THE FIRST NORMAL FORM THIS WILL HAPPEN


	STUDENT TABLE:
		STUDENT_ID 	NAME
		1           TANVIR
		2           ORNOB
		3           SAKIB

	SUBJECT TABLE:
		SUBJECT_ID  NAME
        1           SQL
        2           PYTHON
        3           JAVA
        4           JS

	ENROLLMENT TABLE:
	ENROLLMENT_ID	STUDENT_ID	SUBJECT_ID
	1               1           1
	2               1           2
	3               2           1
	4               2           2
	5               3           4








SECOND NOTMAL FORM (2NF):
	1) MUST BE IN 1 NF
	2) THERE SHOULD BE NO PARTIAL DEPENDENCY

	[WHAT IS PARTIAL DEPENDENCY]
	REMEMBER ALL THE IN A TABLE MUST BE FULLY DEPENDENT ON
	PRIMARY KEY. MEANS ALL THE OTHER VALUE WITLL NE DEPEDENT ON 
	PRIMARY KEY

	THIS ABOUT THIS TABLE AGAIN
	THIS TIME THE THIRD TABLE IS  A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

		STUDENT TABLE:
		STUDENT_ID 	NAME
		1           TANVIR
		2           ORNOB
		3           SAKIB

	SUBJECT TABLE:
		SUBJECT_ID  NAME
        1           SQL
        2           PYTHON
        3           JAVA
        4           JS

	MARKS TABLE:
	ENROLLMENT_ID	STUDENT_ID	SUBJECT_ID   MARK	TEACHER
	1               1           1 			 100	MR.SQL
	2               1           2            40		MR.PYTHON
	3               2           1            50		MR.SQL
	4               2           2 			 60		MR.PYTHON
	5               3           4			 70		MR.JS


NOW IF YOU WAHT TO GET MARKS OF A STUDENT IN ANY SUBJECT YOU CAN QUERY THE MARKS TABLE
IN THERE MARK IS DEPENDENT ON THE THE STUDENT_ID AND SUBJECT_ID

BOTH SO (STUDENT_ID,SUBHET_ID) UNIQUELY DEFINED A ROW. SO BOTH COLUMN IN A TOTAL IS A COMPOSITE KEY. BUT HTE TEACHER ONLY DEPEND ON THE SUBJECT_ID. NOT IN THE STUDENT_ID. SUBJECT_ID DEFINE WHO WILL BE THE TEACHER NOT HE STUDENT_ID.
SO THE TEACHER IS DEPENDED PARTIALLY . NO IT  SHOULD BE REMOVED AND ADDED TO THE SUBJECT COLUMN. 



	STUDENT TABLE:
		STUDENT_ID 	NAME
		1           TANVIR
		2           ORNOB
		3           SAKIB

	SUBJECT TABLE:
		SUBJECT_ID  NAME		TEACHER
        1           SQL 		MR.SQL
        2           PYTHON 		MR.PYTHON
        3           JAVA        MR.JAVA
        4           JS          MR.JS

	MARKS TABLE:
	ENROLLMENT_ID	STUDENT_ID	SUBJECT_ID   MARK	
	1               1           1 			 100	
	2               1           2            40		
	3               2           1            50		
	4               2           2 			 60		
	5               3           4			 70		


THIRD NORMAL FORM (3NF):

1) MUST BE IN 1NF AND 2NF
2) SHOULD NOT HAVE TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY

[ WHAT IS A TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY ]:
 	LETS SEE THE TABLE

 	STUDENT TABLE:
		STUDENT_ID 	NAME
		1           TANVIR
		2           ORNOB
		3           SAKIB

	SUBJECT TABLE:
		SUBJECT_ID  NAME
        1           SQL
        2           PYTHON
        3           JAVA
        4           JS

MARKS TABLE:
ENROLLMENT_ID	STUDENT_ID	SUBJECT_ID   MARK	EXAM	   TOTAL	 
1               1           1 			 100	FIRST_SEM  200
2               1           2            40		FIRST_SEM  200
3               2           1            50		SECOND_SEM 300
4               2           2 			 60		SECOND_SEM 300
5               3           4			 70		SECOND_SEM 250



IN THIS TABLE THE MARK IS DEPENDEDNT ON STUDENT_ID AND SUBJECT_ID
OK. FAIR.

BUT THE "TOTAL" MARKS IS DERECTLY DEPEND ON THE EXAM. YES IT INDIRECTLY DEPENDS ON STUDENT_ID BUT THE TOAL MARKS IS DIRECTLY DEPENDS ON THE EXAM.


LETS BREAK IT DOWN:


 	STUDENT TABLE:
		STUDENT_ID 	NAME
		1           TANVIR
		2           ORNOB
		3           SAKIB

	SUBJECT TABLE:
		SUBJECT_ID  NAME
        1           SQL
        2           PYTHON
        3           JAVA
        4           JS


    EXAM TABLE:
    EXAM_ID	EXAM_NAME
    1 		FIRST_SEM
    2 		SECOND_SEM
    3 		THIRD_SEM

    TOTAL MARK TABLE:
    EXAM_ID 	STUDENT_ID	TOTAL
    1           1           200
    2           2           300
    2           3           250

MARKS TABLE:
ENROLLMENT_ID	STUDENT_ID	SUBJECT_ID   MARK	EXAM_ID	 
1               1           1 			 100	1
2               1           2            40		1
3               2           1            50		2
4               2           2 			 60		2
5               3           4			 70		2

NOW IF WE WANT TO FIND THE TOTAL MARKS WE CAN JUST USE THE COMPOSITE KEY

(STUDENT_ID, EXAM_ID) AND FIND  IT IN THE "TOTAL MARK TABLE"
