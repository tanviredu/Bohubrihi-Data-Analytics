There is, however, a kind of average pooling that is still widely used in the *head* of a convnet. This is **global average pooling**. A `GlobalAvgPool2D` layer is often used as an alternative to some or all of the hidden `Dense` layers in the head of the network, like so:\n\n```\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    pretrained_base,\n    layers.GlobalAvgPool2D(),\n    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'),\n])\n```\n\nWhat is this layer doing? Notice that we no longer have the `Flatten` layer that usually comes after the base to transform the 2D feature data to 1D data needed by the classifier. Now the `GlobalAvgPool2D` layer is serving this function. But, instead of \"unstacking\" the feature (like `Flatten`), it simply replaces the entire feature map with its average value. Though very destructive, it often works quite well and has the advantage of reducing the number of parameters in the model.\n\nLet's look at what `GlobalAvgPool2D` does on some randomly generated feature maps.

Pooling is one of the essential features of convolutional networks and helps provide them with some of their characteristic advantages: efficiency with visual data, reduced parameter size compared to dense networks, translation invariance. We've seen that it's used not only in the base during feature extraction, but also can be used in the head during classification. Understanding it is essential to a full understanding of convnets.\n\n# Keep Going #\n\nIn the next lesson, we'll conclude our discussion of the feature extraction operations with **sliding windows**, the typical way of describing how the convolution and pooling operations scan over an image. We'll describe here the final two parameters in the `Conv2D` and `MaxPool2D` layers: `strides` and `padding`.
