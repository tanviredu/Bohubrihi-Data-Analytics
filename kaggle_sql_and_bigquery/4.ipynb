The condition can be a specific column, a combination of columns, or even a constant value like 1.\n\nConsider the following SQL query:\n\n`\nSELECT department, COUNT(1) as employee_count\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY department;\n`\n\nIn this query, we are trying to count the number of employees in each department. The COUNT(1) part is used to count the number of rows for each department. Here's why COUNT(1) is used:\n\nCounting Rows: In SQL, COUNT() counts the number of non-null values in the specified column. By using COUNT(1), we are effectively counting the number of non-null values in a virtual column where every row has a value of 1. Since all rows contain this value, counting 1 is the same as counting the number of rows.\n\nEfficiency: Counting 1 is often more efficient than other alternatives because it doesn't require checking for NULL values in a specific column. It simply counts the rows.\n\nReadability: Using COUNT(1) is a common convention in SQL to make the query more readable. It's a clear way to indicate that you're interested in counting rows, not specific column values.\n\nSo, in summary, COUNT(1) is used to count the number of rows in a group when you're performing aggregations in SQL. It counts a constant value (1) for each row in the group, which effectively counts the rows themselves. It's a concise and efficient way to achieve row count and is a common practice in SQL queries.\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## write  a query below that selcts the indicator code and indicator name of all codes with \n## at least 175 rows in the year 2016\n#Your code goes here\n## COUNT(1) is used to count number of rows for a specfic condision\n## it is count the row number of a specfic indicator_code in the international_education table \ncode_count_query = \"\"\"SELECT indicator_code,indicator_name,COUNT(1) AS num_rows\n                      FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`\n                      WHERE year=2016\n                      GROUP BY indicator_code,indicator_name\n                      HAVING COUNT(1) >= 175\n                      ORDER BY num_rows DESC\n\"\"\"\n\n# Set up the query\nsafe_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(maximum_bytes_billed=10**10)\ncode_count_query_job = client.query(code_count_query, job_config=safe_config)\n\n# API request -
